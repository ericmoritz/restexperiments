Modern web applications have a number of requirements that both
developers need and users need.  These experiments will compare
solutions presented by REST proponents versus current solutions.

Whenever the status quo is challenged, the burden of proof is on the
challenger.  Each solution presented effects the entire system.  I
will start with a small test and base the next test on the results of
the previous test.

Requirements of a modern web applications
------------------------------------------

A small requirement list of modern web applications are as
follows:

* `Caching`_
* `Data Collation`_
* `Data Relationships`_
* `Sessions`_
